Gradle daemon
Each time we execute the gradle command, a new jvm is started. To reduce the build execution time we can use The command-line option, –daemon, which starts a new Java process which loads Gradle classes and libraries. The next time when we run Gradle with the –daemon option, build will be faster as the JVM with the required Gradle classes and libraries is already running.

gradle --daemon build
gradle --no-daemon build
gradle --stop
How to do profiling
If you want to know about how much time is spent in tasks we can use the –profile command-line option. Gradle generates a report file in the build/reports/profile directory.

gradle --profile build
